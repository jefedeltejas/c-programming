# c-programming
These are programs I've written for my course from metropolia university of applied sciences.

I used the make utility to compile each source code from C to a binary program. 

I've also included the examples from the text, Sams Teach Yourself C Programmingin One Hour a Day, Seventh Edition(Jones, B., Aitken, P., & Miller, D.(2014)), Pearson Education. Sometimes I copy the examples verbatim, and sometimes I do my own improvisations. The choice to do my own thing may result from wanting to have fun, maybe boredom, or perhaps just because I'm a rebel. You decide.

Clone this repo and run them on your own computer if you want to be amazed by such classics as add two numbers, even or odd, or maybe even some string manipulations. Prepare to have your mind blown.
