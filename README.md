# c-programming
These are programs I've written for my course from metropolia university of applied sciences.

I used the make utility to compile each source code from C to a binary program. 

Clone this repo and run them on your own computer if you want to be amazed by such classics as add two numbers, even or odd, or maybe even some string manipulations. Prepare to have your mind blown.
